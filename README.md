# Send via Gmail +

Makes Gmail your default email application and provides a button to compose a Gmail message to quickly share a link via email.

This extension will open a Compose window in Gmail when you click any email address on a webpage. 
It also provides a button that will create a Gmail message when clicked, using the page title as the subject and 
selected page text and link address as the message. 

This extension is very similar to official Extension "Send from Gmail" by Google but improves it in one very important way. 
Now at the time of sending you can specify which of Gmail accounts you are looged into you can use. Click Options to configure
this feature.
